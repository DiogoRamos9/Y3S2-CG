## TP 5 Notes

- In Exercise 1, we created new Vertex and Fragment shaders, which allowed us to paint the top of Bule with yellow and the bottom with blue.

- Also in Exercise 1, we created a gray shader very similiar to sepia.

- In Exercise 2, we applied the water texture to the shaders. We also animated the texture coordinates through time and the vertices through the color of the texture components.
